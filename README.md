Description
Billed is a company that produces SaaS solutions for human resources teams. It consists of two user paths: the HR administrator side and the employee side.

Aim of the project was to improve the employee's career path and make it more reliable by fixing bugs and writing tests. The app had already been developed, the code as well as a description of several bugs were provided.

Objectives
BUG REPORT
fix bugs identified in bug report provided by Jest
bills should be ordered by date from earliest to latest
if admin correctly fills out login fields, they should be able to navigate to dashboard page.
BUG HUNT
BUG 1
Being connected as an employee, it's possible to type in the information for a bill and add a receipt as proof, then submit the receipt using one of the following formats: jpg, jpeg, png.

Going to the bills page and clicking on the icon to display the receipt: the modal opens, but there's no image.

Being connected as an admin and clicking on the corresponding ticket, the name of the receipt file is null. The same thing happens when clicking on the icon to display the receipt: the modal opens, but there's no image.

Expected behavior:

the modal must display the image
on the dashboard, the form associated with the ticket should display the name of the file
BUG 2
Being connected as an admin and opening up a list of tickets (pending, valued, rejected), then select a ticket, then open up a second list, it is not possible to then select a ticket from the first list.

Expected behavior:

be able to open up multiple list and consult the tickets in each one.
